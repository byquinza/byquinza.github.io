# *Hello, I'm Aitor.*

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** at **SAP**, based in the vibrant city of **Barcelona**. 

My professional life is dedicated to building and maintaining robust systems, but my curiosity doesn't stop at the office door.

I'm passionate about keeping up with the ever-evolving landscape of software development. Beyond technology, I'm also fascinated by the insights from **psychology** and the strategies of **business**.

When I'm offline, I enjoy the thrill of **snowboarding**, getting lost in a good series, exploring new places through **travel**, and on a constant quest for the best **gyozas**.
